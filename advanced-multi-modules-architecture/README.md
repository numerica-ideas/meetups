**Summary**: Think of your application like you are doing microservices without paying the full price of microservices architectures, this **advanced multi-modules architecture** should be considered as an intermediate solution to remain on a monolithic base App that can quickly progress to become a microservices infrastructure whenever needed, the idea behind is *we don't need microservices, or at least not now, even better, not when we write the first lines of code of the App*.
